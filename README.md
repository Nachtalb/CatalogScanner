Script to scan video or screenshots of user scrolling through their AC:NH Nook
Shop catalog, DIY recipes list, critters, song list, reactions and more.

This is the source code for the Twitter bot
[@CatalogScanner](https://twitter.com/CatalogScanner), which is an automated
version of this.

## Installation

This script requires
[Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/) and
[Tesseract-OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki) to work.

You can then install the required libraries using pip and requirements.txt:

```shell
cd CatalogScanner
python3 -m venv .env
.env/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Before using this script, you need to create a valid video file. There are many
types of supported media. For the full list alongside instructions for each,
check out <https://nook.lol>.

### Scanning the media

Once you have your video file, you can pass it as the first argument to the
script:

```sh
python scanner.py catalog.mp4
```

If you have screenshots, you can pass it as is if there is a single one,
otherwise you need to number them starting with 0 and pass the filename with
`%d` instead of the numbers.

```sh
python scanner.py catalog_%d.png
```

By default, it will detect the media type (catalog, recipes, etc), but you can
force on with `--mode`.

You can use `--for_sale` to filter out items that are not purchasable, and you
can use `--locale` to adjust the parsed language. By default, the script prints
out the name of all the items found in your catalog video.
